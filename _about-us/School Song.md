School Song
===========

### Music: JJ de Souza

### Lyrics: Seah Lye Huat


When nineteen eighty-seven dawned,

The torch of Zhonghua was first shone;

Calling us all who belong to her,

To set our goals and achieve them together.

**Chorus:**

In all we do, from each his best,

Diligence will bring us success.

Aiming high, always on the go,

Doing well today, even better tomorrow.
