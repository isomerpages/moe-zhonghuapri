Mission and Vision
==================

**The logo encompasses 2 "Zs", one upright and the other, inverted. This signifies training our pupils and staff to be flexible in their outlook in life,particularly in problem solving.**
  
**The logo as a whole is solid in structure. This represents our belief that a school well-founded would flourish.  
The letter "Z" and the wording will be turquoise and black respectively against a white background. The colour turquoise represents vibrant youth.**
