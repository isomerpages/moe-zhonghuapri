Principal's Message
===================

Dear Parents and Friends of the School,

**Ignite Passion for Learning** – “_for if a pupil’s mind is set on fire, he will strive to find a way to provide the fuel_” and the zeal for learning will continue to burn throughout his life. A quote from journalist Sydney J Harris that best exemplifies our mission here at _Zhonghua Primary School_, a mission that continues to inspire all of us to do our best to help our children enjoy  “**Learning for Life**”.  

**To learn for life** is to let our children see the reason behind what they are learning so they can see the relevance and purpose of that learning and be motivated to discover more.

**To learn for life** is to let our children build confidence as they learn and improve at a pace that is right for them, so they develop a sense of self-worth and the determination  to continue on their journey, knowing that there will be many opportunities ahead of them to sieze and to learn.
