MOE has commenced an upgrading programme at ZPS in December 2015 to provide the school with additional facilities to facilitate engaged
=======================================================================================================================================

learning both in academic and non-academic areas. 
==================================================

The upgrading will result in:
=============================

*   Redesigned Classroom, Subject Based Banding Room and Learning Support Rooms.
*   Band Room, Dance Studio, Performing Arts Studio, outdoor running track, an Outdoor Experiential Learning Area, a Flexsi dynamic play area                  with specialised equipment and a purpose built Student Care Centre. 

For ZPS, the bulk of the works will be at the rear open area of the school. While, we will strive to ensure safety and minimise the impact on staff and students, there would be some short term inconveniences that will be unavoidable.  We seek your understanding to support and encourage our children should they experience any discomfort. Please also share with us any concerns that could crop up from time to time.
