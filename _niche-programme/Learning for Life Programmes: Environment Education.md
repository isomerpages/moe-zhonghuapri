Zhonghua Primary School (ZPS) strives to develop our pupils holistically. This is reflected in our school's vision for each and every Zhonghuarian - A Learner, A Thinker, A Leader. Our Environmental Education (EE) approach in our Learning-for-life Programme (LLP) is aligned closely to our school's vision. 

We seek to enhance pupils’ knowledge and understanding  of the environment (Learner), allow them to reflect on environmental issues (Thinker) and provide platforms for them to act and lead so as to take better care of the environment they live in (Leader). In ZPS, we hope to nurture leaders who display the values of responsibility and care towards the environment and to the people around them.
