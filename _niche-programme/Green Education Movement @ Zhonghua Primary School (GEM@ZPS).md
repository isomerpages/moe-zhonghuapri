<p>Zhonghua Primary School (ZPS) strives to develop our pupils holistically.
This is reflected in our school's vision for each and every Zhonghuarian
- A Learner, A Thinker, A Leader. Our Environmental Education (EE) approach
in our Learning-for-life Programme (LLP) is aligned closely to our school's
vision.
<br>We seek to enhance pupilsâ€™ knowledge and understanding&nbsp; of the environment
(Learner), allow them to reflect on environmental issues (Thinker) and
provide platforms for them to act and lead so as to take better care of
the environment they live in (Leader). In ZPS, we hope to nurture leaders
who display the values of responsibility and care towards the environment
and to the people around them.</p>
