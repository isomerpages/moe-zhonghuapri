The logo encompasses 2 "Zs", one upright and the other, inverted.

This signifies training our pupils and staff to be flexible in their outlook in life, particularly in problem solving.

The logo as a whole is solid in structure.

This represents our belief that a school well-founded would flourish.

The letter "Z" and the wording will be turquoise and black respectively against a white background.

The colour turquoise represents vibrant youth.
