<h4><strong>Music: JJ de Souza <br>Lyrics: Seah Lye Huat</strong></h4>
<p>When nineteen eighty-seven dawned,</p>
<p>The torch of Zhonghua was first shone,</p>
<p>Calling us all who belong to her,</p>
<p>To set our goals and achieve them together.</p>
<p>Chorus:</p>
<p>In all we do, from each his best,</p>
<p>Diligence will bring us success,</p>
<p>Aiming high, always on the go,</p>
<p>Doing well today, even better tomorrow.</p>
<p></p>
