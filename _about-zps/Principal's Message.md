#### **<center>Warm greeting from Zhonghua Primary.</center>**
      
I am thankful to be given the opportunity to lead Zhonghua Primary School (ZPS) and to build on the excellent work of Mdm Rostinah and her predecessors. The ZPS vision, mission, values and motto resonate with me and I admire how the entire school community has come together to make a positive difference to past and current Zhonghuarians.

I am also privileged to be able to serve alongside the staff of ZPS, to build on this strong foundation. As we embark on the next phase of the journey together, we are held together by a common set of beliefs.

At ZPS, **we value every student**. We love, value and accept our students for who they are and seek to help them discover their unique personality, strengths and interests. We also believe that **every student wants to succeed**. Every child has hopes and dreams and we are committed to nurturing the whole child in a safe and vibrant learning environment. We believe **all can learn**. As educators, we seek to role model the necessary dispositions to enable students’ learning in the best way possible.

Our school theme for 2024 and beyond is “**Learning, Thinking and Leading for the Future Together**”.

Our focus in ZPS is to provide a learning experience to develop every student into a self-directed **learner**, a creative and reflective **thinker,** and a responsible and caring **leader.** This is developed progressively through the Total Curriculum, which also comprises ZPS signature programmes, namely our Applied Learning Programme (Thinknovate) and our Learning for Life Programme (Green Education Movement@ZPS). In Thinknovate, students use Design Thinking to develop solutions that integrate STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) for sustainability. In GEM@ZPS, students learn values and mindsets to become leaders who display the values of responsibility and care towards the environment and others around.

Moving on, given evolving disruptions with new technology and work, the curricular experience will be designed to facilitate the development of the emerging 21 Century Competencies (e21CC). These e21CC, such as Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking were shared by Minister Chan Chun Sing at the recent MOE Work Plan Seminar. More importantly, our students would need to be anchored on sound values so that they would contribute to the community and Singapore in the future.

We are cognisant that the next phase of the journey must be taken together as a community. Our staff are motivated to care and to provide with the best learning possible for the students’ education. Our Zhonghuarians show care and respect for one another and seek to make a difference as young leaders to the school community. &nbsp;We are also grateful to have strong support from parents and partners.

With your support, we will stride forward to the next chapter in the holistic development of our students to be Learners, Thinkers and Leaders for the Future.
