##### <center>Zhonghua Primary: A Forward-looking School, Preparing Future-ready Students

A lot has been said lately about preparing our students for the future. Our Minister for Education, Mr Chan Chun Sing, in his message to schools in 2022 has also reiterated that it is not enough to prepare our children for just the first 15 years of their education, it is even more important to look at the next 50 years and to ensure they continue learning and be equipped for the future.

What will the next “50 years” be like? Some may envision flying cars, living on the moon, no more diseases…stuff that science fiction is made of.&nbsp; But importantly, we should also ask what the economy will be like, what kind of work will our children be doing and how will people interact with one another. VUCA is the term very commonly used to describe this future: Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous.

We already had a taste of this VUCA future when we experienced the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-2022 and the accompanying trials and tribulations that it brought about. Many valuable lessons could be drawn as we observed how Singapore and the world coped with the VUCA uncertainty of Covid-19. **Volatility** was countered with **Vision** and an action-oriented approach, **Uncertainty** was replaced with **Understanding** through perspective-taking and challenging assumptions. **Complexity** was changed to **Clarity** by breaking issues into parts and forming teams to deal with the parts in a flexible and creative manner. **Ambiguity** was substituted with **Agility** through taking an experimentation and innovation approach and firm decision-making by leaders.

These same lessons on preparing for the VUCA world are emphasized in our school as we build that **Self-Directed and Resilient Learner** who can confidently share his views and work collaboratively with others in teams, the **Creative Thinker**, who is curious and flexible yet reflective of his actions and respectful of ideas from others and finally, the **Responsible Leader** who empathises with the plight of others and cares for the future of the environment.

Our teachers are key to the development of these dispositions in our student and the school continues to invest in building their capacity and supporting their growth within and beyond the school so that together we can all rally behind MOE’s call for us at Zhonghua Primary to build a Forward-looking School and Future-ready Students.
