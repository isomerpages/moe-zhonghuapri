<p>The school's name&nbsp;**'中华'**&nbsp;(Zhonghua) originated from the old
name for 'Chung Hwa Girls' School' founded by a Chinese clan association
in 1911 to provide a basic education for the children of the Chinese community.
It was developed into a full school in 1951. The primary school site was
at Niven Road and the secondary school site was at Bartley Road with the
new name "Chung Hwa Girls' High School". It became a government-aided school
in 1957. In 1962, to promote better school management, the classes at the
two sites had separate principals.</p>
<p>In 1980, Chung Hua Girls' Primary School at Niven Road was closed down
due to declining enrolment which was a consequence of parental demand for
English-medium schools. However, Chung Hwa Girls' High School accepted
its first intake of English-medium pupils. The school moved to Serangoon
Avenue 4 in December 1986 and was renamed "Zhonghua Secondary School".</p>
<p>Zhonghua Primary School, based on the P101 design, was built next to the
Zhonghua Secondary School at a cost of $4.6 million. It is equipped with
all modern facilities. It is a government school which started functioning
on 2 January 1987 as a single session. It was officially opened by Mr Goh
Choon Kang, MP for Braddell Heights on 6 July 1989.</p>
<p>The school had undergone PERI Upgrading works from 2015 to 2017 and is
now equipped with facilities of the latest specifications. The upgrading
has resulted in Redesigned Classroom, Subject Based Banding Room, Learning
Support Rooms, Band Room, Dance Studio, Performing Arts Studio, outdoor
running track, an Outdoor Experiential Learning Area, a Flexi dynamic play
area with specialised equipment and a purpose-built Student Care Centre.</p>
<p>The school has built a strong foundation through the past Principals.
The current Principal, Mrs Chan Le Chin, is the 7th Principal of the school.</p>
