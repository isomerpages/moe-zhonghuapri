<p>The school's name&nbsp;'中华'&nbsp;(Zhonghua) originated from the old name
for 'Chung Hwa Girls' School' founded by a Chinese clan association in
1911 to provide a basic education for the children of the Chinese community.
It was developed into a full school in 1951. The primary school site was
at Niven Road and the secondary school site was at Bartley Road with the
new name "Chung Hwa Girls' High School". In 1957, it became a government-aided
school.
<br>In 1980, Chung Hua Girls' Primary School ceased operations because of
higher parental demand for English-medium schools. In 1986, Chung Hwa Girls’
High School moved to its present location at Serangoon Avenue 4 and was
renamed Zhonghua Secondary School.
<br>Subsequently, Zhonghua Primary School was rebuilt next to Zhonghua Secondary
School. In 1987, the school operated as single-session government school.
On 6 July 1989, it was officially opened by Mr Goh Choon Kang, MP for Braddell
Heights. In 2001, the school underwent PRIME upgrading and in 2007, Serangoon
Garden South School was merged with the school.
<br>The school had undergone PERI Upgrading works from 2015 to 2017. The upgrading
has resulted in Redesigned Classrooms, Subject Based Banding Rooms, Learning
Support Rooms, Band Room, Dance Studio, Performing Arts Studio, outdoor
running track, an Outdoor Experiential Learning Area, a Flexi dynamic play
area with specialised equipment and a purpose-built Student Care Centre.
<br>The school has built a strong foundation through the past Principals.
The current Principal, Mrs Chan Le Chin is the 7th Principal of the school.
