<p>Welcome to Zhonghua Primary School (ZPS), where we are committed to nurturing
every child to be a <strong>Learner, a Thinker, and a Leader</strong>. At
ZPS, we are guided by our mission to develop our students with strength
of character and passion in learning. This philosophy has served us well
in our journey of educational excellence and continues to be our compass
as we prepare our students for an ever-changing world.</p>
<p>At ZPS,&nbsp;<strong>we value every student</strong>. We love, value and
accept our students for who they are, whilst believing that <strong>all can learn and succeed</strong>.
Whether in the classroom, on the sports field, or on the stage, we provide
opportunities for every child to celebrate their successes, discover their
strengths and pursue their passions.</p>
<p>Our school theme for 2026 is "<strong>Learn, Think, Shine!</strong>" Alongside
sound teaching practices and meaningful learning experiences, I am excited
to share that our distinctive programmes will provide more authentic platforms
for students to have a voice and be empowered.</p>
<p>In our Thinknovate programme, students use Design Thinking to develop
solutions that integrate STEM for sustainability. Our Green Education Movement@ZPS
helps students learn values and mindsets to become student leaders for
the community and the environment. Through our Outdoor Leadership and Environmental
Education (OLE) Programme, students learn to overcome their fears and build
important character and leadership traits such as resilience, responsibility
and care.</p>
<p>We are also enhancing our learning spaces to make learning more engaging
and experiential. Our newly refurbished canteen now includes a collaborative
zone for student activities and projects, and further enhancements are
planned to create an inspiring learning environment.</p>
<p>We believe every child has the potential to shine. When our students shine,
they inspire one another and create a positive learning environment for
all. This happens through strong partnerships with parents and the community,
where students feel supported and safe to make mistakes, learn and grow.
As we look ahead, I am optimistic about what we can achieve together at
ZPS. With your support, we will continue developing our students to be
Learners, Thinkers and Leaders for the future.</p>
