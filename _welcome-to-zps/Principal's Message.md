<h1><strong><u>Principal’s Message</u></strong></h1>
<p>Welcome to Zhonghua Primary School (ZPS), where we are committed to nurturing
every child to be a Learner, a Thinker, and a Leader. At ZPS, we are guided
by our mission to nurture our students to have strength of character and
passion in learning. This philosophy has served us well in our journey
of educational excellence and continues to be our compass as we prepare
our students for an ever-evolving world.</p>
<p>At ZPS,&nbsp;<strong>we value every student</strong>. We love, value and
accept our students for who they are. We also believe that&nbsp;<strong>all can learn and succeed</strong>.
As educators, we seek to role model the necessary dispositions to enable
students’ learning in the best way possible and nurture the whole child
in a safe and vibrant learning environment, so that they can be the best
that they can be. Whether in the classroom, on the sports field, or on
the stage, we provide opportunities for every child to celebrate their
successes, discover their strengths and pursue their passions.</p>
<p>Our school theme is “<strong>Learning, Thinking and Leading for the Future Together</strong>”.
To this end, our dedicated educators create dynamic learning environments
to progressively develop good learning dispositions, thinking skills and
a desire to lead self and others through caring and responsible actions.
Besides sound teaching practices and meaningful learning experiences, our
distinctive programmes provide authentic platforms for the development
of 21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies. In our Thinknovate programme, students
use Design Thinking to develop solutions that integrate STEM (Science,
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) for sustainability. In our Green
Education Movement@ZPS, students learn values and mindsets to become leaders
who display the values of responsibility and care towards the environment
and others around. In our Outdoor Leadership and Environmental Education
(OLE) Programme, our students learn to overcome their fears and build important
character and leadership traits such as resilience, responsibility and
care.</p>
<p>We believe that it takes a village to grow a child. Our partnership with
parents and the community has been crucial to create a supportive environment
where students feel loved and safe to make mistakes, learn and grow. With
your continual support, we will stride forward to the next chapter in the
holistic development of our students to be Learners, Thinkers and Leaders
for the Future.</p>
