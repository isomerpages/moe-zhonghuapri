<h1><strong><u>School History</u></strong></h1>
<h1><strong>Humble Beginnings with a Strong Mission </strong></h1>
<p>Chung Hwa Girls' School was established at Mohamad Sultan Road by the
Chinese community in 1911 as the first Chinese-medium girls' school. Its
establishment was a timely development for women during an era when the
roles and contributions of women in society were being redefined.</p>
<p>In 1925, to meet the need for larger premises, the school was shifted
to No. 57, Niven Road. By 1951, with the support from the community, Chung
Hwa Girls’ School evolved to be a full school comprising Primary, Secondary
and Pre-University sections. The secondary classes then shifted to Bartley
Road and became "Chung Hwa Girls' High School”. Chung Hua Girls' Primary
School remained at Niven Road and ceased operations in 1980 because of
higher parental demand for English-medium schools.</p>

<h1><strong>New Beginnings at Serangoon Avenue 4</strong></h1>
<p>Zhonghua's history underwent several significant transformations. In 1987,
Chung Hwa Girls' High School relocated to Serangoon Avenue 4 and was renamed
Zhonghua Secondary School (中华中学). During this period, Zhonghua Primary
School (中华小学) was also rebuilt adjacent to the secondary school to meet
the educational demands of the community.</p>
<p>On 6 July 1989, Mr Goh Choon Kang, MP for Braddell Heights, officially
opened the primary school. The school continued to develop over the years,
undergoing PRIME upgrading in 2001. A significant change occurred in 2007
when Serangoon Garden South School merged with Zhonghua Primary School.
More recently, between 2015 and 2017, the school underwent PERI upgrading
works to enhance its facilities and infrastructure. The upgrading has resulted
in refreshed facilities, such as Redesigned Classrooms, Specialized Rooms
for different learning needs and Outdoor Experiential Learning Areas. &nbsp;</p>
