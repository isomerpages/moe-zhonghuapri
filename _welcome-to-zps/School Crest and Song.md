<p>The school crest features two "Z"s for Zhonghua (中华): the upright Z represents
strength of character and cultural roots, while its inverted counterpart
symbolises our students' ability to view challenges from different perspectives,
adapt to change, and innovate solutions for society's betterment. Together,
they form a solid structure, reflecting our belief that a school built
on strong foundations will flourish.</p>
<p>Rendered in vibrant turquoise against white, the crest embodies our commitment
to nurturing youth who are both anchored in timeless values and equipped
with the flexible mindset needed to thrive in tomorrow's world.</p>
