Library Matters
===============

USEFUL LINKS 

  

Great news from our Zhonghua School Library!  

  

All pupils can use Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) to find the book they like from our library collection.

  

The URL address is:

All pupils can also use School eResource Repository (SERR), a virtual school library.

  

It aims to promote recreational reading as well as support learning for students across various subject areas. The repository provides easy access to online resources.
