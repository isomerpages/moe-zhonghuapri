Notes To Parents/Guardians
==========================

##### **Communication**  

Your child’s form teacher would have issued an introductory letter to you on the first day of school concerning class routines, expectations, and preferred modes of communication.

  

Please refer to the Pupil’s Diary 2020 for updated information and other useful information about the school. Do communicate with us through the diary, phone calls or emails. If you wish to see anyone of us, kindly make an appointment and wait at the General Office for the required staff member.

  

It is the child’s responsibility to ensure that they take down what needs to be done in their diary. This is about teaching responsibility. If we do not start now, they will never learn.

##### Absence from School

We would appreciate it if you could call in the morning to let us know if your child is absent. The office phone number is 6283 5413. Medical certificates should be submitted to the form teacher upon the child’s return to school. If your children are sick, please keep them at home.

  

##### School Attire

Pupils are to be attired in their full school uniform on all days that they do not have PE. On the days they have PE, they may wear their PE attire instead of their shirts/blouses throughout the day. On Fridays, all pupils are to wear their PE T-shirts and shorts for the mass workout.

  

##### Road Safety

Please ensure that your children follow the traffic rules and cross safely at pedestrian crossings. They should always look both ways and listen for oncoming traffic before crossing roads. A school attendant will be on hand to ensure that they cross safely at the zebra crossing outside the school.

  

##### Security and Safety

To ensure the safety of our pupils, staff and stakeholders, several procedures have been put in place to make the school a safe place for all. Visitors are to check-in using SafeEntry system.

  

The opening hours for the Main (vehicular) Gate, Side Gate and the Back Gate are as follows:
