pic<br>CCA is an important part of our pupilsâ€™ holistic education. In ZPS, we offer a wide range of CCAs, catering to the varied interest and capabilities of our pupils. It is also our objective not only to teach them the CCA specific skills, but also to cultivate in our pupils the spirit of teamwork, integrity in their pursuit for excellence. Having the CCA experience with the other Zhonghuarians will also allow them to build camaraderie and desirable social behaviours. The school carried out the Annual CCA Selection Exercise for all P3 pupils starting Term 1 Week 9. In order to assist our P3 pupils to make an informed decision on their choice of preferred CCAs, the school conducted a CCA Exposure Programme as part of the CCA Selection Exercise. By Term 2 Week 2, the pupils were allocated to a CCA based on their preferred choices and started their first CCA training session on 28 March.<br>SH PE
