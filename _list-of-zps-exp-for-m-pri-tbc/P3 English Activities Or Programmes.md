<br>P3 Oracy Enrichment (Speech &amp; Drama) Through the Speech and Drama enrichment programme, our pupils will be trained to speak in a communicative and enjoyable way. The programme also aims to foster imaginative thinking and creative expression amongst our pupils. It will introduce pupils to the various speech techniques such as good pronunciation, rhythm, expression and voice projection and to respond willingly and with confidence. Various drama, group and solo performances will also be conducted during the programme. At the end of the programme, pupils will get to perform in front of an audience.<br>HOD EL/LH EL
