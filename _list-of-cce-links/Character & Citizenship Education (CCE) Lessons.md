# **Character & Citizenship Education (CCE) Lessons**
CCE lessons refer to the teaching of values, knowledge and skills for CCE in Mother Tongue Language (MTL). For pupils who offer the non-Tamil Indian Languages (NTIL), namely, Bengali, Punjabi and Urdu as their Mother Tongue and for those who are exempted from taking MTL, CCE will be taught in English. To cater to these students, Instructional Materials (IMs) will also be available in English. To further support teachers in the teaching of CCE, facilitation tool bags were also distributed by MOE.

The new Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) syllabus was introduced in 2014 for Primary 1 & 2, and in 2015 for the other levels. Designed with studentsâ€™ daily experiences as context, the new CCE syllabus will help students to better relate to them and make learning more meaningful and relevant. Students will learn values through three overarching ideas - Identity, Relationships and Choices in six domains, starting with self and extending to the family, school, community, nation and the world.
