<br>4 NE Commemorative Events
<br>Schools are required to commemorate 4 core NE events which have been identified
as defining moments in Singapore's history. The aim is to entrench these
events and the images they evoke in the consciousness of each successive
generation. As part of each Zhonghuarian’s experience in the school, the
CCE department provides the opportunity for them to experience the following
NE events:
<br>1. Total Defence Day (TDD)
<br>The school cmmemorates Total Defence Day on&nbsp;15 February annually
to mark Singapore's fall to the Japanese in 1942. Total Defence Day serves
to remind our pupils that Singapore is defensible and is worth defending,
and we ourselves must defend Singapore.
<br>2. International Friendship Day
<br>The school commemorates IFD on the 3rd Friday of Term 2 that is a working
day. International Friendship Day is a day dedicated to the understanding
of Singapore's relations with neighbouring countries and beyond. It aims
to sensitise our children towards the geo-political realities inherent
in Singapore, as well as nurture in our students the spirit of friendship
and collaboration among different people.
<br>3. Racial Harmony Day
<br>The school commemorates Racial Harmony Day on 1st July annually. On this
day in 1964, Singapore saw racial riots. Racial Harmony Day serves to remind
our pupils that social division costs us dearly and that race and religion
are potential fault-lines in Singapore society. It is a day for schools
to reflect on, and celebrate our success as a harmonious nation and society
built on a rich diversity of cultures and heritages.
<br>4. National Day
<br>National Day marks Singapore's Separation from Malaysia, and her emergence
as an independent country in the community of nations. Since 1998, a National
Day Ceremony was introduced in schools. This Ceremony aims to bring to
the students a greater sense of the historical importance and solemnity
of National Day. The school normally conducts the National Day Observance
Ceremony on 8th August annually.</p>
