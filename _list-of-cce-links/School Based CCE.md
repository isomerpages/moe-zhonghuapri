<h1><strong>School Based CCE</strong></h1>
<p>To promote ownership of&nbsp;CCE&nbsp;and to meet the needs of the students
in each school, part of the&nbsp;CCE&nbsp;syllabus and programmes will
be designed and implemented by schools. Schools will be provided curriculum
time to deliver school-based&nbsp;CCE. School-based&nbsp;CCE&nbsp;could
include activities or lessons on school values or assembly programmes related
to&nbsp;CCE.</p>
<p>Values Talk by School Leaders
<br>Launched in 2015, the school leaders actively role model the inculcation
of CCE by speaking to the pupils regularly. They share stories centering
on different school values, and remind the pupils on the importance of
having good character and sound moral values.</p>
