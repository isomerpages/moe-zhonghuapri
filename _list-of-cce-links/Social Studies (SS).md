<h1><strong>Social Studies (SS)</strong></h1>
<p>At the heart of the Singapore Social Studies (SS) curriculum is the preparation
of our pupils to be citizens of tomorrow by helping them to better understand
the interconnectedness in Singapore and the world they live in, and appreciate
the complexities of the human experience. Drawing on the social life that
is of meaning and interest to the learners, SS seeks to ignite pupils’
curiosity to inquire into real-world issues that concern their lives. Through
inquiry and authentic learning experiences, SS helps pupils to attain relevant
knowledge and understandings of these issues, develop critical and reflective
thinking skills, and appreciate multiple perspectives. SS seeks to inculcate
in pupils a deeper understanding of the values that define the Singaporean
society and nurture dispositions to show concern for the world they live
in and demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others. The curriculum
therefore envisions the SS pupil as an informed, concerned and participative
citizen who is competent in quality decision-making with an impassioned
spirit to contribute responsibly in the world he/she lives in.
<br>Curriculum Aims SS seeks to develop the civic competencies of our pupils
by the end of a full course in Social Studies education. Civic competencies,
which encompass the body of knowledge, skills and values expressed in the
philosophy of SS, will empower students to be informed, concerned and participative
citizens.
<br>As an <strong>informed citizen</strong>, the pupil would:
<br>1. understand his/her own identity vis-à-vis his/her identity as a Singaporean

<br>4. apply reflective thought in making quality decisions;
<br>5. analyse, negotiate and manage complex situations; and
<br>6. evaluate information, consider different viewpoints and exercise discernment
in reaching well-deliberated conclusions and responsible decisions.
<br>As a <strong>concerned citizen</strong>, the pupil would:
<br>1. have a sense of belonging to his community and nation;
<br>2. find it important to engage in issues of societal concern because he/she
understands the potential impact his/her response has on society;
<br>3. show commitment to social cohesion by appreciating diversity in society;
and
<br>4. have an awareness of the ethical consequences of decision-making.

<br>1. be motivated to identify issues of concern and take action;
<br>2. be resilient in addressing concerns of the community or society in
spite of challenges faced; and
<br>3. be empowered to take personal and collective responsibility for effecting
change for the common good; and serve to make a positive difference to
others.
