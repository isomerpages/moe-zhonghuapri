During the CCE lessons, pupils from the various Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) and Non-Mother Tongue (NMT) classes were involved in the designing and colouring of paper bookmarks meant for the incoming juniors and invited guests.

**Distribution of Mandarin Oranges**

  

On 12 and 13 February, pupils from the Non-Mother Tongue (NMT) class championed the packing of mandarin oranges into bags while the various Mother Tongue Language (MTL) classes went about the distribution of these ‘bags of love’ during the Mother tongue periods on 16 February.

  

4 classes visited our immediate neighbours in the vicinity, and another 2 classes paid a special visit to St Luke’s Eldercare (Serangoon) to surprise and bring joy to the elders there. Through this simple yet meaningful activity, pupils learnt skills such as working in teams, listening to others, active participation and they also had the chance to learn more about the Chinese culture, as well as the importance of social cohesion and racial harmony.Values-In-Action for Primary 4 (Apr - May 2015).
