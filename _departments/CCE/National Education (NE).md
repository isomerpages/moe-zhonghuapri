**4 NE Commemorative Events**

Schools are required to commemorate 4 core NE events which have been identified as defining moments in Singapore's history. The aim is to entrench these events and the images they evoke in the consciousness of each successive generation. As part of each Zhonghuarian’s experience in the school, the CCE department provides the opportunity for them to experience the following NE events:

Total Defence Day (TDD)  
The school commemorates Total Defence Day on 15 February annually to mark Singapore's fall to the Japanese in 1942. Total Defence Day serves to remind our pupils that Singapore is defensible and is worth defending, and we ourselves must defend Singapore.    

International Friendship Day  
The school commemorates IFD on the 3rd Friday of Term 2 that is a working day. International Friendship Day is a day dedicated to the understanding of Singapore's relations with neighbouring countries and beyond. It aims to sensitise our children towards the geo-political realities inherent in Singapore, as well as nurture in our students the spirit of friendship and collaboration among different people.  
  
Racial Harmony Day  
The school commemorates Racial Harmony Day on 21st July annually. On this day in 1964, Singapore saw racial riots. Racial Harmony Day serves to remind our pupils that social division costs us dearly and that race and religion are potential fault-lines in Singapore society. It is a day for schools to reflect on, and celebrate our success as a harmonious nation and society built on a rich diversity of cultures and heritages.  
  
National Day  
National Day marks Singapore's Separation from Malaysia, and her emergence as an independent country in the community of nations. Since 1998, a National Day Ceremony was introduced in schools. This Ceremony aims to bring to the students a greater sense of the historical importance and solemnity of National Day. The school normally conducts the National Day Observance Ceremony on 8th August annually.
