Values-In-Action (VIA)
======================

Values-In-Action (VIA) refers to learning experiences that support pupils’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of knowledge, skills and values. VIA encourages pupils’ ownership of their learning, and how they contribute to the community. As part of VIA, pupils reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully. Students will reflect on their VIA experiences, to reinforce the learning and internalise the values. Curriculum time will be set aside during Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons for reflection. At Zhonghua Primary, the VIA outcomes for pupils include demonstrating care, taking an active part to better the lives of others, having a strong sense of civic responsibility, staying rooted to Singapore and being informed about Singapore and the World.
