Information
================

To promote ownership of CCE and to meet the needs of the students in each school, part of the CCE syllabus and programmes will be designed and implemented by schools. Schools will be provided curriculum time to deliver school-based CCE. School-based CCE could include activities or lessons on school values or assembly programmes related to CCE.

**Values Talk by School Leaders**

Launched in 2015, the school leaders actively role model the inculcation of CCE by speaking to the pupils regularly. They share stories centering on different school values, and remind the pupils on the importance of having good character and sound moral values.
