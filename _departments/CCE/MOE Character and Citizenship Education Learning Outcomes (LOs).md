MOE Character and Citizenship Education Learning Outcomes (LOs)
===============================================================

The Learning Outcomes (LOs) of CCE state what we want our students to learn and attain. The CCE core values are embedded in the 8 LOs. LOs 1 to 4 depict different aspects of character building that are interrelated and feature social and emotional competencies. LOs 5 to 8 are guided by key tenants of 21stÂ century citizenship and arranged according to attributes of citizenship such as identity, culture, and active, responsible engagement as a member of society.
