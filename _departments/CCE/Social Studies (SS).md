Social Studies (SS)
===================

At the heart of the Singapore Social Studies (SS) curriculum is the preparation of our pupils to be citizens of tomorrow by helping them to better understand the interconnectedness in Singapore and the world they live in, and appreciate the complexities of the human experience. Drawing on the social life that is of meaning and interest to the learners, SS seeks to ignite pupils’ curiosity to inquire into real-world issues that concern their lives. Through inquiry and authentic learning experiences, SS helps pupils to attain relevant knowledge and understandings of these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking skills, and appreciate multiple perspectives. SS seeks to inculcate in pupils a deeper understanding of the values that define the Singaporean society and nurture dispositions to show concern for the world they live in and demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others. The curriculum therefore envisions the SS pupil as an informed, concerned and participative citizen who is competent in quality decision-making with an impassioned spirit to contribute responsibly in the world he/she lives in.

Curriculum Aims SS seeks to develop the civic competencies of our pupils by the end of a full course in Social Studies education. Civic competencies, which encompass the body of knowledge, skills and values expressed in the philosophy of SS, will empower students to be informed, concerned and participative citizens.

As an **informed citizen**, the pupil would:

• understand his/her own identity vis-à-vis his/her identity as a Singaporean with a global outlook;

• understand different perspectives;

• view the world with an understanding of the Singapore perspective;

• apply reflective thought in making quality decisions;

• analyse, negotiate and manage complex situations; and

• evaluate information, consider different viewpoints and exercise discernment in reaching well-deliberated conclusions and responsible decisions.

As a **concerned citizen**, the pupil would:

• have a sense of belonging to his community and nation;

 • find it important to engage in issues of societal concern because he/she understands the potential impact his/her response has on society;

• show commitment to social cohesion by appreciating diversity in society; and

 • have an awareness of the ethical consequences of decision-making.

As a **participative citizen**, the pupil would:

• be motivated to identify issues of concern and take action;

• be resilient in addressing concerns of the community or society in spite of challenges faced; and

• be empowered to take personal and collective responsibility for effecting change for the common good; and serve to make a positive difference to others.
