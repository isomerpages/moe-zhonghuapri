<h2><strong>ICT &amp; Ed Tech</strong></h2>
<p>The ICT Department is dedicated to equipping students with the digital
literacy and future-ready skills essential for success in a fast-evolving
world. In alignment with MOE’s National Digital Literacy Programme and
the “Find, Think, Apply, Create” framework, our school adopts a systemic
and progressive approach to nurture computational thinking from as early
as Primary 1. Through our Coding and Making programme, students are introduced
to coding using screen-free tools like MatataLab in the lower primary years,
and advance to block-based programming platforms such as Scratch, Microsoft
PXT, and <a href="http://Code.org" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Code.org</a> in
upper levels. Supported by initiatives like the iMDA Code for Fun programme,
students learn to break down problems, recognise patterns, design algorithms,
and troubleshoot solutions — developing valuable skills such as experimentation,
iteration, abstraction, and teamwork. Our students work collaboratively
on real-world challenges, pitch solutions to peers, and proudly present
their digital creations. These experiences not only ignite their digital
creativity and innovation but also cultivate resilience, communication,
and collaborative problem-solving – key traits of confident digital</p>
