Information and Communication Technology
========================================

### Coding and Making – Developing Digital Literacy in Our Pupils

In 2020, MOE unveiled the National Digital Literacy Programme so that at different stages of their education journey, pupils will be able to acquire digital skills across four components in the “Find, Think, Apply, Create” framework.

In line with the national development pathway, the school has a systemic approach to develop computational thinking in our pupils through coding and making.

##### **Computational Skills**

The intent of coding is to develop computational thinking in our pupils starting from Primary 1. The programme spiral upwards and develop pupils progressively in this higher order thinking competencies. Computational thinking includes elements such as:

·         Decomposition – breaking a large problem down into smaller ones

·         Pattern recognition – recognising how these smaller problems relate to ones that have been solved in the past

·         Algorithm design – Identifying and refining the steps necessary to reach a solution

·         Debugging – Refining those steps.

Developing computational thinking will also develop the following skill sets in our pupils:

·        Experimenting and iterating – developing something, trying it out, and then developing some more

·        Testing and debugging – finding and solving problems as they work

·        Abstracting and modularizing – exploring connections between the whole and the parts
