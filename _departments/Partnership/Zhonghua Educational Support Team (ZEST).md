### **Information**
Zhonghua Educational Support Team (ZEST) that was established in February 1997 is a vital link in helping to promote a strong partnership between home and school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Our ZEST members support us in a variety of areas and capacities.&nbsp; They provide us with tireless commitment to school events and provide valuable feedback to the school through focused group discussions for improvement. ZEST members derive a great sense of fulfilment and satisfaction from their efforts and contributions to the school.&nbsp;

Joining ZEST is a commitment from parents to be actively involved in their childâ€™s education and development in school. If you are interested in being part of our ZEST family, we would be delighted to welcome you. Come join us and embark on a fulfilling journey with your child as a Parent Volunteer. Together, we can create a cheerful &amp; enriching experience for you and your child in Zhonghua!
