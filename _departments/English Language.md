# **English Language**
At ZPS, we don’t just prepare our pupils for examinations. We are committed to developing our pupils language skills – reading, writing, listening, speaking, viewing and representing – to prepare them for life. We envisioned our pupils to be expert readers and effective communicators, competent to use English language in different social settings.
