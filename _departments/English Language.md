<h1><strong>English Language</strong></h1>
<p>At ZPS, we don’t just prepare our pupils for examinations. We are committed
to developing our pupils language skills – reading, writing, listening,
speaking, viewing and representing – to prepare them for life. We envisioned
our pupils to be expert readers and effective communicators, competent
to use English language in different social settings.</p>
