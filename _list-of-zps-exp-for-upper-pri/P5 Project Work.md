### **8 to 12 May 2023**
pic<br>Project Work at P5 aims to provide the pupils with the opportunity to apply their knowledge and make links across different areas of knowledgeas well as to generate, develop and evaluate ideas and information. Students will also hone their communication skills when they learn to present ideas clearly and coherently to their selected audience in both the written and oral forms. Apart from working collaboratively, students will also have the opportunity to learn on their own, reflect on their learning and take appropriate actions to improve. The P5 pupils will learn how to code and fly a drone. With this knowledge, pupils will need to use the drone to assist them with their solution. Pupils will create a diorama of their solution and present their project work to their peers.<br>PW Leader Talib
