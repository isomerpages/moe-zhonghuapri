As part of the National Education programme, the P5 pupils are given the opportunity to be part of the National Day Preview. The NE show is a key cohort experience for Primary 5 pupils to gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be Singaporean. Through this collective experience, we also hope that the pupils will have a deepened appreciation of what we can do as a nation and how we can forge ahead, as a nation, in the future.
