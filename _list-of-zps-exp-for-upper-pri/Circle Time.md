### **Date**
pic<br>Circle Time is a time that we have set aside for teachers and pupils to build positive relationships, to listen to one another as well as to solve problems that they are facing as a class. It is a dedicate time set aside for teachers and pupils to chat about matters that are important to the class. Through Circle Time, we hope to promote a positive classroom culture and positive interactions between pupils and teachers. At Upper Primary, topics of discussion range from managing workload and homework, managing expectations, managing friendships as well as coping with stress.<br>YHs<br>S:\\ZPS\_Levels\\Circle Time\\Circle Time Photos
