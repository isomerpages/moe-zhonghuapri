Project Work will be carried out as part of their Post PSLE Programme as it allows them more time and space to truly focus on working on the project. At P6 the PW aims to provide the pupils with the opportunity to apply their knowledge and make links across different areas of knowledgeas well as to generate, develop and evaluate ideas and information. Students will also hone their communication skills when they learn to present ideas clearly and coherently to their selected audience in both the written and oral forms. Apart from working collaboratively, students will also have the opportunity to learn on their own, reflect on their learning and take appropriate actions to improve. More information will be provided at a later time.
