<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,
<br>The Edusave Character Award (ECHA) was introduced in 2012 to enable schools
to recognise students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding
personal qualities through their behaviour and actions.
<br>This is part of the larger goal to foster an inclusive and stronger Singapore
as we broaden the qualities and achievements to be encouraged and applauded.
<br>The award also supports schoolsâ€™ continuing efforts in nurturing students
of character and values, who are active contributors and concerned citizens.
<br>You may refer to the attached letter for more details. Please take note
of the deadline for submission as late submissions will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Please email me at <a href="mailto:teh_khen_hian@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">teh_khen_hian@moe.edu.sg</a> for
further inquiries or to submit ECHA form at <a href="https://form.gov.sg/admin/form/66cfaea5d3db3d611ead79ea" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://form.gov.sg/admin/form/66cfaea5d3db3d611ead79ea</a>
