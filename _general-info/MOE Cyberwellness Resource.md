<p>What is Cyber Wellness?</p>
<p>Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users.
It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to
protect oneself in cyberspace. The focus of Cyber Wellness is about helping
students to become responsible digital learners. This digital age brings
with it tremendous opportunities and risks. The online world is especially
rich with content for learning, socialising and entertainment. As your
child learns to access, use and create such content, it is important that
they do so safely and responsibly.</p>
<p>Useful tips on Cyber Wellness</p>
<p>Today's digital age allows online news and information to easily reach
our children. However, not all that are shared on the internet may be true.
When our children start to believe and act on news that are untrue, they
may likely experience anxiety and stress. It is therefore important to
equip all our children with a few simple ways to spot fake news so as not
to fall prey to the dangers online.</p>
<p>Let's learn to be safe and smart digital users together!</p>
