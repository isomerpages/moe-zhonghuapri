<h2><strong>Leave of Absence (LOA) scheme</strong></h2>
<p>The LOA scheme allows your child to rejoin their school after they return
from overseas. They can be re-admitted to the school directly after returning
to Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility</strong>
</p>
<p>LOA applies to all children who are Singapore Citizen or Singapore Permanent
Resident only.&nbsp; To be granted LOA, your child must fulfil all two
(2) of the following criteria:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our current student who is a Singapore
Citizen or Singapore Permanent Resident.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accompanying the parent overseas
only due to the reasons below with the intention of rejoining their school
after returning to Singapore:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents are on overseas posting;
OR</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents are attending to their business
overseas; OR</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents are going overseas for a
company-related training/further studies.</p>
<p>Your child also qualifies for LOA if they are already registered for Primary
1 (P1) but will be overseas at the start of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Fees</strong>
</p>
<p>Schools will charge an annual nominal fee for a child on LOA. The amount
will be determined by individual schools.</p>
<p>At the end of each year, you will need to decide whether to renew the
LOA for another year. Your child’s LOA status will expire if you choose
not to renew.</p>
<p><strong>Support for your child</strong>
</p>
<p>The school will provide support in the following areas to ease your child's
return upon parent's request:</p>

returning arrangements, updates on important dates for admissions exercises,
etc.</p>
