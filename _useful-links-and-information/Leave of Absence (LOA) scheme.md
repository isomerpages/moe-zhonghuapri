# **Leave of Absence (LOA) scheme**
The LOA scheme allows your child to rejoin their school after they return from overseas. They can be re-admitted to the school directly after returning to Singapore.

**Eligibility**

LOA applies to all children who are Singapore Citizen or Singapore Permanent Resident only.  To be granted LOA, your child must fulfil all two (2) of the following criteria:

1.       Our current student who is a Singapore Citizen or Singapore Permanent Resident.

2.       Accompanying the parent overseas only due to the reasons below with the intention of rejoining their school after returning to Singapore:

-       Parents are on overseas posting; OR

-       Parents are attending to their business overseas; OR

-       Parents are going overseas for a company-related training/further studies.

Your child also qualifies for LOA if they are already registered for Primary 1 (P1) but will be overseas at the start of the year.

**Fees**

Schools will charge an annual nominal fee for a child on LOA. The amount will be determined by individual schools.

At the end of each year, you will need to decide whether to renew the LOA for another year. Your child’s LOA status will expire if you choose not to renew.

**Support for your child**

The school will provide support in the following areas to ease your child's return upon parent's request:

1.       Administrative: Renewal of LOA, returning arrangements, updates on important dates for admissions exercises, etc.

2.       Academic: Provide major test and examination papers with answers, where appropriate, on a regular basis, and access to Student Learning Space (SLS) portal that enables your child to keep up-to-date with our national curriculum.
