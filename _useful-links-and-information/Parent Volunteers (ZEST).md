# **Parent Volunteers (ZEST)**

Zhonghua Educational Support Team (ZEST) that was established in February 1997 is a vital link in helping to promote a strong partnership between home and school.&nbsp;

Our ZEST members support us in a variety of areas and capacities.&nbsp; They provide us with tireless commitment to school events and provide valuable feedback to the school through focused group discussions for improvement. ZEST members derive a great sense of fulfilment and satisfaction from their efforts and contributions to the school.

Joining ZEST is a commitment from parents to be actively involved in their child’s education and development in school. If you are interested in being part of our ZEST family, we would be delighted to welcome you. Come join us and embark on a fulfilling journey with your child as a Parent Volunteer. Together, we can create a cheerful &amp; enriching experience for you and your child in Zhonghua!
