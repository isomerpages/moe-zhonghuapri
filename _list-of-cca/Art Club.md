ZPS Art Club is the choice CCA for pupils who love and enjoy Visual Arts. In our CCA, pupils will get to explore different art mediums and tools. They are given opportunities to express their creativity through creating a variety of 2D and 3D artworks and develop a great appreciation for the arts. Pupils will also gain knowledge and skills through learning about the different art forms from different time periods. During Art Club sessions, pupils are provided with opportunities to become confident learners as they learn more about themselves and learn how to work with others. Pupils in the Art Club will also have opportunities to participate in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and other competitions.
