<p>The Environmental Science Club (ESC) is an exciting CCA where students
who are passionate about championing environmental causes gather to empower
the community to protect the Earth! Our budding environmentalists will
dive into a variety of opportunities which will enable them to <strong>learn </strong>more
about upcycling, <strong>think </strong>creatively as they develop effective
solutions to resolve environmental issues, and <strong>lead </strong>in
the sharing of environmental knowledge. The ESC club members experience
the innovation of upcycling through fun-filled activities held in collaboration
with Terra SG. They also embark on the courses of research and idea development
through competitions such as the annual GreenWave Contests. The insights
they have gained from these experiences inspire change in the school's
environmental measures as they reach out to fellow Zhonghuarians to share
their love for the planet and raise awareness on climate change. The ESC
club aims to nurture social leaders who will grow into caring advocates
who will inspire positive change in the protection of the environment.</p>
