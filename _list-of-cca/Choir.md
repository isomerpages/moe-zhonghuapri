Our ZPS Choir is made up of a group of young members who are full of zest and display a great passion for singing. Through the practices and rehearsals, the members build strong bonds with one another. Our ZPS Choir is exposed to a plethora of repertoire besides learning to take good care of their vocal health through building proper breathing support and singing techniques. They will also learn basic musicianship such as reading and following scores, which promote self-directed learning. During practices, the choir learns how to appreciate and create music individually and in teams. These experiences provide the members the opportunity to work with and learn from their peers. Members also exhibit the inculcated school values during their practices and external performances. They are resilient and provide great moral and mental support for their peers when the going gets tough.
