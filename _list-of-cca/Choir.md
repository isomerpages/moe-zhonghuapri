<p>Our ZPS Choir is made up of a group of young members who are full of zest
and display a great passion for singing. Through the practices and rehearsals,
the members build strong bonds with one another. Our ZPS Choir is exposed
to a plethora of repertoire besides learning to take good care of their
vocal health through building proper breathing support and singing techniques.
They will also learn basic musicianship such as reading and following scores,
which promote self-directed learning. During practices, the choir learns
how to appreciate and create music individually and in teams. These experiences
provide the members the opportunity to work with and learn from their peers.
Members also exhibit the inculcated school values during their practices
and external performances. They are resilient and provide great moral and
mental support for their peers when the going gets tough.</p>
