Football is a team sport that requires players to work together towards a common goal. Being part of the Football CCA can help pupils develop their teamwork and collaboration skills, as they learn how to communicate effectively with their teammates, support each other, and achieve success together. Being part of a soccer CCA requires pupils to commit to regular training sessions, competitions, and other events. This can help pupils develop discipline and commitment, as they learn to manage their time effectively and prioritize their responsibilities. Overall, being part of a soccer CCA can help pupils develop a range of skills and qualities that are valuable both on and off the field.

ZPS Football shapes its members to become resilient by exposing them to challenging training routines and exposing them to many different competitions in the local football scene. Members build up physical and mental strength and in turn make improvements in their performance in the sport as well as their general health and fitness. With this programme, the Football teachers’ in-charge and coaches will run the pupils through a series of planned activities designed to enhance their skills as well as improve coordination, fitness and enjoyment of the game of football.
