Football is a team sport that requires players to work together towards a common goal. Being part of the Football CCA can help pupils develop their teamwork and collaboration skills, as they learn how to communicate effectively with their teammates, support each other, and achieve success together. Being part of a football CCA requires pupils to commit to regular training sessions, competitions, and other events. This can help pupils develop discipline and commitment, as they learn to manage their time effectively and prioritize their responsibilities. Overall, being part of a football CCA can help pupils develop a range of skills and qualities that are valuable both on and off the field.
