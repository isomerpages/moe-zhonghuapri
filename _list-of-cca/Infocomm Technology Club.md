<p>The Infocomm Technology Club aims to broaden and deepen members’ knowledge
in Technological skills and Computational Thinking skills through various
learning programmes such as Game Design, Programming, Makers and Artificial
Intelligence. Students will also get to apply what they have learnt, with
hands on experience in making prototypes related to sustainability themes.
These programmes develop our members’ interest in the various areas and
hone their 21st Century skills, dispositions and competencies. Students
are given the opportunity to lead in, both national competitions and activities
within the club. Through these experiences, students will acquire values
such as teamwork and resilience.</p>
