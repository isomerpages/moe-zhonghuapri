<p>Football is a team sport that requires players to work together towards
a common goal. Being part of the Football CCA can help pupils develop their
teamwork and collaboration skills, as they learn how to communicate effectively
with their teammates, support each other, and achieve success together.
Being part of a soccer CCA requires pupils to commit to regular training
sessions, competitions, and other events. This can help pupils develop
discipline and commitment, as they learn to manage their time effectively
and prioritize their responsibilities. Overall, being part of a soccer
CCA can help pupils develop a range of skills and qualities that are valuable
both on and off the field.</p>
<p>ZPS Football shapes its members to become resilient by exposing them to
challenging training routines and exposing them to many different competitions
in the local football scene. Members build up physical and mental strength
and in turn make improvements in their performance in the sport as well
as their general health and fitness. With this programme, the Football
teachers’ in-charge and coaches will run the pupils through a series of
planned activities designed to enhance their skills as well as improve
coordination, fitness and enjoyment of the game of football.</p>
