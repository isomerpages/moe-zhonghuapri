<p>In our Indian Dance CCA, students from diverse ethnic background come
together to learn various forms of folk and classical dances. Our experienced
dance instructor and the CCA teachers guide our students during their practice
sessions. This provides them the platform to showcase their talents. They
get the opportunities to perform for the various occasions and events such
as The Singapore Youth Festival, Prize Giving Day and Deepavali concert.
Through this CCA, they will develop holistically and gain experience to
the different cultures, boost their confidence and learn to work in harmony.</p>
