The Environmental Science Club (ESC) is an exciting CCA where students who are passionate about championing environmental causes gather to empower the community to protect the Earth! Our budding environmentalists will dive into a variety of opportunities which will enable them to **learn** more about upcycling, **think** creatively as they develop effective solutions to resolve environmental issues, and **lead** in the sharing of environmental knowledge. The ESC club members experience the innovation of upcycling through fun filled activities held in collaboration with Terra SG. They also embark on the courses of research and idea development through competitions such as the annual GreenWave Contests. The insights they have gained from these experiences inspires change in the school's environmental measures as they reach out to fellow Zhonghuarians to share their love for the planet and raise awareness on climate change. The ESC aims to nurture social leaders who will grow into caring advocates who will inspire positive change in the protection of the environment.
