<p>Volleyball is a mentally challenging sport that requires players to stay
focused, stay calm under pressure, and make quick decisions. Pupils who
play volleyball learn how to manage their emotions and develop mental toughness,
which can help them in all areas of their lives. Being part of a soccer
CCA can teach pupils about the importance of good sportsmanship, including
how to win and lose gracefully, respect their opponents, and follow the
rules of the game. Overall, playing volleyball can help pupils develop
a range of physical, social, and emotional skills that are valuable both
on and off the court.</p>
