The Recreational Badminton Team aims to develop discipline, resilience, responsibility, and fair play in our students. We hope that through the training sessions, students can achieve a higher level of proficiency in their badminton skills and become lifelong active citizens. Badminton is a sport that requires technique, agility, hand-eye coordination and tactical thinking. We want our students to not only develop interest for the sport, but also acquire the skills needed to play a game of badminton. The Badminton Club also provides a platform for students to display the school’s values of discipline, resilience and responsibility. Through friendly matches, they also learn important values such as sportsmanship and fair play.
