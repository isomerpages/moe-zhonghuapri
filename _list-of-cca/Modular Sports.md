<p>The Modular-Sports CCA aims to expose the members to multiple sports within
their CCA Journey in ZPS and develop discipline, resilience, responsibility,
and fair play in our students. We hope that through the training sessions,
students can discover their interests and talents in the sports that they
are exposed to and become lifelong active citizens. The training sessions
provide a platform for students to display the school’s values of discipline,
resilience and responsibility. Through friendly matches, they also learn
important values such as sportsmanship and fair play. This year, the CCA
Members will be exposed to Floorball and Handball. They will be grouped
by their levels and rotated between the 2 sports after 12 sessions.</p>
