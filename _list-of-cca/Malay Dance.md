<p>The Malay Dance CCA aims to promote joy for learning the traditional dance
forms of the Malay communities in Singapore which are wide-ranging and
diverse. They include&nbsp;zapin,&nbsp;joget,&nbsp;asli&nbsp;and&nbsp;inang
amongst others. Male and female dancers of the CCA, under the guidance
of our professional instructors, will be given opportunities to showcase
their dance skills for Singapore Youth Festival and other community events.
Overall, being in a Malay dance CCA can develop a student holistically
and provide a unique cultural experience that enriches their personal growth
and learning.</p>
