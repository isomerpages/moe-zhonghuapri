<p>The Malay Dance CCA aims to promote joy for learning the traditional dance
forms of the Malay communities in Singapore which are wide-ranging and
diverse. They include zapin, joget, asli and inang amongst others. Male
and female dancers of the CCA, under the guidance of our professional instructors,
will be given opportunities to showcase their dance skills at the Singapore
Youth Festival and other community events. Overall, being in a Malay dance
CCA can develop a student holistically and provide a unique cultural experience
that enriches their personal growth and learning.</p>
