<p>Zhonghua Educational Support Team (ZEST) that was established in February
1997 is a vital link in helping to promote a strong partnership between
home and school.</p>
<p>Our ZEST members support us in a variety of areas and capacities. They
provide us with tireless commitment to school events and provide valuable
feedback to the school through focused group discussions for improvement.
ZEST members derive a great sense of fulfilment and satisfaction from their
efforts and contributions to the school.</p>
<p>Joining ZEST is a commitment from parents to be actively involved in their
childâ€™s education and development in school. If you are interested in being
part of our ZEST family, we would be delighted to welcome you. Come join
us and embark on a fulfilling journey with your child as a Parent Volunteer.
Together, we can create a cheerful &amp;amp; enriching experience for you
and your child in Zhonghua!</p>
