<h1><strong>Edusave Character Award (ECHA)</strong></h1>
<p>The Edusave Character Award (ECHA) was introduced in 2012 to enable schools
to recognise students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding
personal qualities through their behaviour and actions. This is part of
the larger goal to foster an inclusive and stronger Singapore as we broaden
the qualities and achievements to be encouraged and applauded. The award
also supports schoolsâ€™ continuing efforts in nurturing students of character
and values, who are active contributors and concerned citizens.
