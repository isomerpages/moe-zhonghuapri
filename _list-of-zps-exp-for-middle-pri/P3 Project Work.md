### **15 to 18 May 2023**
![](/images/Middle%20Primary%20Experience/p3%20project%20work%20gif.gif)<br>For P3 Project Work, pupils will get to apply curriculum knowledge and skills to represent real-world issues and build representative prototypical solutions and ideas. These representations in the form of artefacts or prototypes show how the pupils sharpen their critical thinking skills to discover a solution for a real world problem. In the process of thinking, working together and making, the pupils also develop their collaborative skills, listening to ideas from their peers and articulating their own views. At the end of the project work, the pupils are given a platform to present their learning in front of their peers.<br>PW Leader Nelson
