pic<br>P4 Outdoor Leadership and Environmental Education The OLE programme provide opportunities for our pupils to connect with nature, work together as a team, and learn about environmental issues. For P4, the pupils will spend a day at Pasir Ris Park where they will get to do a simple hiking activity to experience and see flora and fauna up close and personal as part of their learning experience and work together as a team to complete challenging tasks.<br>SH PE
