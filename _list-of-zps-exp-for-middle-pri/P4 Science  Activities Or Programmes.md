pic<br>P4 Science ZPS (Zeal for Protected Species) Poster &amp; Presentation Competition The P4 Science ZPS Poster &amp; Presentation Competition is an opportunity for pupils to advocate support for the one of the many endangered species in the world today. Pupils select and profile a species using a Poster/Presentation, educating their peers about these endangered species and how each person can play a part in preserving them. Pupils are recognised for their efforts and products in their individual classes as well as across the level. Through this competition, pupils get to practice important Values, Ethics and Attitudes in Science (eg. Curiosity, Creativity, Open-mindeness and Responsibility).<br>HOD SCI
