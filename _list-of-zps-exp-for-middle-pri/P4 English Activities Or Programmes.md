P4 Oracy Enrichment (Public Speaking) The Public Speaking programme is a speech presentation programme that aims to nurture an active speaking and listening culture among the pupils. Through this programme, pupils will be taught to plan and present a speech within certain specifications and to present pertinent arguments in their favour. Effective communication skills will be developed through diverse speaking opportunities. Pupils will have opportunities to present talks that are informative, persuasive and argumentative and at the same time there will also be a focus on clear enunciation in both reading and speech. In addition, audience culture and etiquette such as the use appropriate body language, stance and facial expressions and the need for eye contact will be inculcated in pupils. Vocal techniques will be introduced to improve the quality of the individual speaking voice. By the end of the programme, pupils would have gained confidence in standing before an audience and delivering their prepared speeches.
