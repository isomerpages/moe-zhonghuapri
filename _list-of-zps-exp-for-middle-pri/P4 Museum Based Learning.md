![](/images/Middle%20Primary%20Experience/p4%20museum%20based%20learning%20gif.gif)<br>Museum Based Learning As part of the art curriculum, Zhonghuarians undergo activities to understand art as a way of learning about themselves and the world around them. One of such experiences is catered for the Primary 4 pupils, who are given the opportunity to visit an art museum (e.g National Gallery Singapore) to gain more insights to art and museum education. Pupils will be brought on a guided tour where they will be introduced to the museum space and artworks created by local artists. These authentic learning opportunities allows students to familiarize themselves with art appreciation, strengthening their observation, inferential and communication skills.<br>SH PAM/ Alicia
