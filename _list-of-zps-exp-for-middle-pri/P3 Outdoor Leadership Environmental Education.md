pic<br>The OLE programme provide opportunities for our pupils to connect with nature, work together as a team, and learn about environmental issues. For P3, the programme is integrated into the P3 Science Zoo Trip. For OLE, the pupils will get to do simple orienteering and experience and see flora and fauna up close and personal as part of their learning experience and work together as a team to complete challenging tasks.<br>SH PE/ HOD SCI
