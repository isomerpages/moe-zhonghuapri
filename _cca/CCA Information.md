<h2><strong>CCA Information</strong></h2>
<h4><strong>CCA Programme in ZPS</strong></h4>
<p>CCA is an important part of our studentsâ€™ holistic education. In ZPS,
we offer a wide range of CCAs, catering to the varied interest and capabilities
of our students. It is also our objective not only to teach them the CCA
specific skills, but also to cultivate in our students the spirit of teamwork,
integrity in their pursuit for excellence. Having the CCA experience with
the other Zhonghuarians will also allow them to build camaraderie and desirable
social behaviours.</p>
<p>While CCA is not compulsory in Primary Schools, we strongly encourage
our students to participate in a CCA. We strongly believe that CCAs are
important platforms to inculcate good values in our students, as well as
to develop them with competencies to adapt to the demands of the 21st century.</p>
<h4><strong>Timeframe for CCA Work Year 2025</strong></h4>
<p>CCAs will commence in <a href="https://zhonghuapri.moe.edu.sg/cca-schedule-for-semester-1-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">January 2025</a> and
run till <a href="https://zhonghuapri.moe.edu.sg/cca-schedule-for-semester-2-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Oct/Nov 2025</a>.</p>
