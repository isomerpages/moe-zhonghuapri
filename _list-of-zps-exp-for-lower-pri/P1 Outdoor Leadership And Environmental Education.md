pic<br>The OLE programme provide opportunities for our pupils to connect with nature, work together as a team, and learn about environmental issues. For P1, the pupils spent a day in school where they learn to distinguish the recyclable and non-recyclable materials, build confidence through basic obstacle courses such as the River Crossing and work together as a team to complete challenging tasks.<br>SH PHE Mr Azman
