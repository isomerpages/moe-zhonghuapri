pic<br>The Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is an integral part of the Primary 1 and 2 curriculum. Through PAL, the P1 and P2 pupils at ZPS undergo learning experiences that are active, hands-on, and meaningful. They get to develop and hone soft skills (also known as social emotional learning – SEL) such as the ability to communicate clearly and cooperate with others. At ZPS, we do this through the experiential nature of PAL within four main domains - Sports &amp; Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts.<br>SH PAM Mr Tang
