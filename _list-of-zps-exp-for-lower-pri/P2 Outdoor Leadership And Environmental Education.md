![](/images/Lower%20Primary%20Experience/2023%20p2%20ole%20.gif)<br>The OLE programme provide opportunities for our pupils to connect with nature, work together as a team, and learn about environmental issues. For P2, the pupils spent a day in Jacob Ballas Childrenâ€™s Garden where they get to do simple orienteering, experience and see plants up close and personal, build confidence through basic obstacle courses such as the Flying Fox and work together as a team to complete challenging tasks.<br>SH PHE Mr Azman
