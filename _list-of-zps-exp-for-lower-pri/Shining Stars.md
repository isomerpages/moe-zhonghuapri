ZPS P1 and P2 Shining Stars is a speech and drama programme that culminates in a showcase performance. It is a platform to build confident and resilient Zhonghuarians from their early formative years, through the use of speech and drama techniques. The programme provides a stimulating environment aligned with ZPSâ€™ focus on developing confident, compassionate and critical thinkers.
