P1 & P2 pupils will embark on Project Work (PW) for the first time in 2023. Pupils will have the opportunity to collaborate and work to address a current real world issue. Their PW journey will be crafted using the Design Thinking process and will culminate in a showcase by each group on the last day. Pupils will demonstrate learning dispositions suitable for their age group while gaining experience in dealing with the real world problem of pollution.
