<h2>Notes To Parents &amp; Guardians</h2>
<h4></h4>
<p>Communication
<br>Your child’s form teacher would have issued an introductory letter to
you on the first day of school concerning class routines, expectations,
and preferred modes of communication.
<br>
</p>
<p>Please refer to the Pupil’s Diary for updated information and other useful
information about the school. Do communicate with us through the diary,
phone calls or emails. If you wish to see anyone of us, kindly make an
appointment and wait at the General Office for the required staff member.
<br>
</p>
<p>It is the child’s responsibility to ensure that they take down what needs
to be done in their diary. This is about teaching responsibility. If we
do not start now, they will never learn.
<br>
<br><strong>Absence from School</strong>
<br>We would appreciate it if you could call or WhatsApp in the morning to
let us know if your child is absent. The office phone number or the school’s
WhatsApp number is 6283 5413. Medical certificates should be submitted
to the form teacher upon the child’s return to school. If your children
are sick, please keep them at home.
<br>
<br><strong>School Attire</strong>
<br>Pupils are to be attired in their full school uniform on all days that
they do not have PE or PAL periods. On the days they have PE or PAL periods,
they may wear their PE attire instead of their shirts/blouses throughout
the day.
<br>
<br><strong>Road Safety</strong>
<br>Please ensure that your children follow the traffic rules and cross safely
at pedestrian crossings. They should always look both ways and listen for
oncoming traffic before crossing roads. A school attendant will be present
to ensure that they cross safely at the zebra crossing outside the school.
<br>

<p><strong>Opening and Dismissal Time</strong>
