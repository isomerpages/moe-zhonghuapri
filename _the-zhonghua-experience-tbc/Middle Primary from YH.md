<br>Circle Time is a time set aside for teachers and pupils to build positive relationships, to listen to one another, to solve problems that they are facing as a class. It is also a time for teachers and pupils to chat about matters that are important to the class. Through Circle Time, we hope to promote a positive classroom culture and positive interactions between pupils and teachers. Topics of discussions range on making friends, looking out for friends, social skills, seeking help and managing time at home.

<br>CCA is an important part of our pupils’ holistic education. In ZPS, we offer a wide range of CCAs, catering to the varied interest and capabilities of our pupils. It is also our objective not only to teach them the CCA specific skills, but also to cultivate in our pupils the spirit of teamwork, integrity in their pursuit for excellence. Having the CCA experience with the other Zhonghuarians will also allow them to build camaraderie and desirable social behaviours. The school carried out the Annual CCA Selection Exercise for all P3 pupils starting Term 1 Week 9. In order to assist our P3 pupils to make an informed decision on their choice of preferred CCAs, the school conducted a CCA Exposure Programme as part of the CCA Selection Exercise. By Term 2 Week 2, the pupils were allocated to a CCA based on their preferred choices and started their first CCA training session on 28 March.

<br>For P3 Project Work, pupils will get to apply curriculum knowledge and skills to represent real-world issues and build representative prototypical solutions and ideas. These representations in the form of artefacts or prototypes show how the pupils sharpen their critical thinking skills to discover a solution for a real world problem. In the process of thinking, working together and making, the pupils also develop their collaborative skills, listening to ideas from their peers and articulating their own views. At the end of the project work, the pupils are given a platform to present their learning in front of their peers.

<br>Museum Based Learning As part of the art curriculum, Zhonghuarians undergo activities to understand art as a way of learning about themselves and the world around them. One of such experiences is catered for the Primary 4 pupils, who are given the opportunity to visit an art museum (e.g National Gallery Singapore) to gain more insights to art and museum education. Pupils will be brought on a guided tour where they will be introduced to the museum space and artworks created by local artists. These authentic learning opportunities allows students to familiarize themselves with art appreciation, strengthening their observation, inferential and communication skills.
