<br>Circle Time is a time that we have set aside for teachers and pupils to build positive relationships, to listen to one another as well as to solve problems that they are facing as a class. It is a dedicate time set aside for teachers and pupils to chat about matters that are important to the class. Through Circle Time, we hope to promote a positive classroom culture and positive interactions between pupils and teachers. At Upper Primary, topics of discussion range from managing workload and homework, managing expectations, managing friendships as well as coping with stress.

<br>pic
<br>Project Work at P5 aims to provide the pupils with the opportunity to apply their knowledge and make links across different areas of knowledgeas well as to generate, develop and evaluate ideas and information. Students will also hone their communication skills when they learn to present ideas clearly and coherently to their selected audience in both the written and oral forms. Apart from working collaboratively, students will also have the opportunity to learn on their own, reflect on their learning and take appropriate actions to improve. The P5 pupils will learn how to code and fly a drone. With this knowledge, pupils will need to use the drone to assist them with their solution. Pupils will create a diorama of their solution and present their project work to their peers.

<br>As part of the National Education programme, the P5 pupils are given the opportunity to be part of the National Day Preview. The NE show is a key cohort experience for Primary 5 pupils to gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be Singaporean. Through this collective experience, we also hope that the pupils will have a deepened appreciation of what we can do as a nation and how we can forge ahead, as a nation, in the future.
