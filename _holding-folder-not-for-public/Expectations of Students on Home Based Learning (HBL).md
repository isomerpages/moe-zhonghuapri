Expectations of Students on Home Based Learning (HBL)
=====================================================

**Expectations of Students on Home Based Learning (HBL)**

*   Students are to follow the timing for HBL based on their levels:

    * P1 – P3: 12 p.m. – 4 p.m.
    * P4 – P6: 8 a.m. – 12 p.m.

*   HBL instructions and plans are posted on SLS daily and sent to parents via PG.

*   Students are advised to follow the timetable and keep to the time allocated for each assignment. However, if students are unable to complete the HBL assignments within the time given, they may complete the work throughout the course of the day.

*   Students should stay focused during the 4 hours set aside for HBL and to refrain from other non-educational distractions e.g. watching television, playing games etc.

*   Students are encouraged to participate in HBL in a conducive environment to minimise distractions.

*   Students should gather all their materials, books and stationery to prepare for HBL to stay focused in learning.

*   In the event when students encounter difficulties in the assignment, they are encouraged to seek help from their teachers. This can be done through:
    * SLS Portal
    * Writing email to the teachers
    * Seeking help from peers via email or SLS portal

*   For technical assistance, students may refer to the school helpline or SLS helpdesk:
