=======================

**★ Changes to the PSLE Scoring and Secondary One Posting ★**

Changes to the PSLE Scoring and S1 Posting will be made as part of a larger shift to nurture well-rounded individuals and move away from an over-emphasis on academic results. To be implemented starting from the 2021 PSLE cohort, the changes aim to:

1.       Reduce fine differentiation of students

2.       Reflect a student’s level of achievement regardless of how his peers have done

3.       Encourage families to choose schools based on their suitability for the child’s learning needs, talents and interests.
