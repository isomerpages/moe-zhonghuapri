<p>The Recreational Badminton Team aims to develop discipline, resilience,
responsibility, and fair play in our students. We hope that through the
training sessions, students can achieve a higher level of proficiency in
their badminton skills and&nbsp;become lifelong active&nbsp;citizens. Badminton
is a sport that requires technique, agility, hand-eye coordination and
tactical thinking. We want our students to not only develop interest for
the sport, but also acquire the skills needed to play a game of badminton.
The Badminton Club also provides a platform for students to display the
school’s values of discipline, resilience and responsibility. Through friendly
matches, they also learn important values such as sportsmanship and fair
play.</p>
