<h4><strong>Music: JJ de Souza <br>Lyrics: Seah Lye Huat</strong></h4>
<p>When nineteen eighty-seven dawned,
<br>The torch of Zhonghua was first shone,
<br>Calling us all who belong to her,
<br>To set our goals and achieve them together.
<br>Chorus:
<br>In all we do, from each his best,
<br>Diligence will bring us success,
<br>Aiming high, always on the go,
<br>Doing well today, even better tomorrow.</p>
<p></p>
