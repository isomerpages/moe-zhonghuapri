HBL
===
Dear Parents/Guardians,

With the sharp increase in the number of community cases, including the spike in unlinked cases today, there is a need to reduce interactions and avoid the risk of large clusters. As such, the Ministry of Education (MOE) will be stepping up precautionary measures to safeguard the well-being of all students and staff.

All primary, secondary, junior college (JC) and Millennia Institute (MI) students will shift to full Home-Based Learning (HBL) from 19 May 2021 (Wednesday) till end of the term on 28 May 2021 (Friday).

Schools will remain open for students who require additional support. Preschools and student care centres will also remain open during this period to support parents who need to work. Parents working in essential services or who are unable to secure alternative care arrangements, may approach their children’s primary schools for assistance.

During the full HBL phase, schools will provide instructions and support for students to access a range of both online and hardcopy HBL materials, so that learning continues uninterrupted. The Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) platform will continue to be accessible to students. Students who require digital devices or internet access may contact their schools for assistance. Teachers and school personnel will keep in regular contact with students and parents to provide support. 

The mid-year GCE O- and A-Level Mother Tongue Language examinations will proceed as planned and with strict Safe Management Measures (SMMs) in place.

**ZHONGHUA PRIMARY SCHOOL HOME-BASED LEARNING**

The school will shift to Home-Based Learning (HBL) from 19 May 2021 (Wednesday) till end of the term on 28 May 2021 (Friday).

To ensure a smoother online learning experience, we have segregated the HBL timing for different levels. They are:

HBL timing for P4 – P6 students: 8am – 12pm

HBL timing for P1 – P3 students 12pm – 4pm

Daily lesson plans will be sent via PG the day before. The plan outlines the learning activities that your child has for the following day. Your child will also be able to access the plan when they log into SLS Portal.

Please find attached the HBL plan for 19 May. Helplines and more resources can be found on the school’s website.

Do help to encourage your child to carry out the learning plan and complete the tasks assigned to the best of his/her ability. Thank you for your continued partnership with the school and we hope you and your family will be safe and well. 

Together we can overcome this. Stay safe!
