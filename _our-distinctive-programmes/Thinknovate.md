<h2><strong>Thinknovate</strong></h2>
<p>Our Thinknovate programme aligns with MOE's vision for 21st Century Competencies,
focusing on developing Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking through
STEM-based education.</p>
<p>The programme employs the Design Thinking Approach to nurture students
holistically:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>As&nbsp;Learners, they cultivate empathy and develop deep understanding
of real-world challenges</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As&nbsp;Thinkers, they engage in critical reflection and creative ideation
to develop innovative solutions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As&nbsp;Leaders, they prototype and implement meaningful solutions, driving
positive change in their community</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our structured, age-appropriate learning experiences are delivered through
two tiers:</p>
<p><strong>Tier 1: Foundation Programmes</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Young Thinknovater (P1/2): Introduction to coding and STEM concepts using
MataLab, Lego and Strawbees during curriculum time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thinknovate Challenge (P1-6): Termly competitions where students design,
build and test STEM-based solutions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project Work (P1-6): Four-day curriculum-based programme applying Design
Thinking methodology</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tier 2: Advanced Development</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Infocomm Technology CCA for deeper STEM engagement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participation in external competitions (Python@Yuying Secondary, Pinnacle@Peicai)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach develops both technical competencies and innovative mindsets,
preparing students for an increasingly technology-driven world.</p>
