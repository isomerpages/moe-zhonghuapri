<h2><strong>Outdoor Adventure, Leadership Building and Environmental Education Programme (OLE)</strong></h2>
<p>Our OLE programme is built on the foundation that every student can be
a leader, drawing from 'The Leader in Me' principles. We create authentic
leadership opportunities through outdoor adventures, while using the environment
as a third teacher to integrate environmental education.</p>
<p>Our approach develops students holistically through three dimensions:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>As&nbsp;Learners, they discover and embody school values and leadership
qualities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As&nbsp;Thinkers, they reflect critically on their outdoor experiences
and challenges</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As&nbsp;Leaders, they develop self-leadership and learn to guide others
effectively</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our outdoor learning journey progresses thoughtfully across primary levels.
Lower primary students (P1-2) begin with fundamental outdoor skills and
safety awareness, exploring navigation and road safety within school grounds
and the neighbourhood. In middle primary (P3-4), students venture into
community spaces like Bidadari Park and Serangoon Gardens, where they develop
collaborative leadership skills through team-based activities focusing
on communication and group dynamics. Upper primary students (P5-6) advance
to more challenging experiences at outdoor adventure campsites and water
sports centre where they engage in activities such as abseiling, rock climbing
and canoeing to build resilience, adaptability and problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>Through these carefully structured experiences, students progressively
build confidence, leadership capabilities and environmental awareness in
increasingly challenging outdoor settings.</p>
