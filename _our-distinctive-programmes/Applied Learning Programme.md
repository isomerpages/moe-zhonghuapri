<p>Thinknovate is our unique signature STEM-based Applied Learning Programme.
STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. At Zhonghua
Primary School, every pupil goes through a progressive Applied Learning
Programme starting from P1 to P6. The programme is school-based and designed
by our teachers contextualised to the needs of our pupils. It begins with
P1 young learners exploring with screen-free coding tool such as MatataLab
and learning to code through mini-challenges provided by their pupils.</p>
