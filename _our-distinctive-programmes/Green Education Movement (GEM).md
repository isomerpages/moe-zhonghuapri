<h2><strong>Green Education Movement @ Zhonghua Primary School (GEM@ZPS)</strong></h2>
<p>Environmental sustainability is a key focus of our educational approach,
aligned with both the Singapore Green Plan 2030 (SGP30) and the MOEâ€™s Eco
Stewardship Programme. We integrate environmental education across four
key domains: curriculum, campus infrastructure, school culture and practices,
and community partnerships.</p>
<p>Our environmental education framework develops students holistically through
three dimensions:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>As <strong>Learners</strong>, they develop knowledge and understanding
of environmental issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As <strong>Thinkers</strong>, they critically reflect on environmental
challenges and solutions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As <strong>Leaders</strong>, they take meaningful action to protect and
improve their environment</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;We deliver age-appropriate learning experiences through a tiered
approach:</p>
<p><strong>Tier 1: Foundation Programmes</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>School-wide recycling and upcycling initiatives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Active participation in environmental commemorative events (e.g. World
Water Day, Earth Hour)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Green Education Movement (GEM) monitor-led ambassador programmes to promote
environmental consciousness</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tier 2: Advanced Engagement</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Student-led kindergarten outreach programmes and environmental education
during Open House</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specialised Environmental Science Club as a Co-Curricular Activity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participation in prestigious environmental competitions (e.g. Dunman High
World Water Day Challenge, Greenwave Environmental Care Competition)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This structured approach ensures our students develop both environmental
literacy and stewardship capabilities, preparing them to be responsible
citizens who contribute to Singapore's sustainable future.</p>
