<h3><strong>CCA Information</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) at Zhonghua Primary School</strong>
<br>At ZPS, CCAs play a vital role in nurturing the holistic development of
our students. We offer a diverse range of CCAs to cater to different interests
and strengthsâ€”from sports and performing arts to clubs and uniformed groups.
Beyond skill acquisition, our programmes are designed to instil strong
values such as teamwork, integrity, and perseverance. Through shared experiences
with fellow Zhonghuarians, students build lasting friendships, social confidence,
and a deep sense of belonging.</p>
<p>While CCA participation is optional in primary schools, we strongly encourage
our students to take part. CCAs provide rich opportunities for character
development and equip students with essential life skills to thrive in
a fast-changing world.</p>
