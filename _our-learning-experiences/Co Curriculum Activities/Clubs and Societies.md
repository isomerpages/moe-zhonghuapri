<h2><strong>Clubs and Societies</strong></h2>
<p>At Zhonghua Primary School, our Clubs and Societies—including the Environmental
Science Club and Infocom Technology (ICT) Club—offer dynamic platforms
for students to explore real-world issues through innovation and collaboration.
In the ICT Club, members use tools such as Lego Spike Prime, basic coding,
and AI concepts to prototype tech solutions that support sustainability
goals Working in teams, students apply STEM approaches to solve authentic
challenges such as reducing waste, conserving energy, and designing sustainable
living solutions. In the Environmental Science Club, students who are passionate
about championing environmental causes gather to empower the community
to protect the Earth! Our budding environmentalist students engage in upcycling
projects, climate action campaigns, and research initiatives like the GreenWave
competition. They dive into a variety of opportunities which will enable
them to learn more about upcycling, think creatively as they develop effective
solutions to resolve environmental issues, and lead in the sharing of environmental
knowledge. Through these hands-on experiences, our students develop critical
thinking, teamwork, and resilience—emerging as confident, future-ready
learners empowered to make a positive impact on the world.</p>
