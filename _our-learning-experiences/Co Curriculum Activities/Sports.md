<h2><strong>Sports CCAs</strong></h2>
<p>Our Sports CCAs—including Volleyball, Football, and Modular Sports—provide
students with enriching opportunities to develop physical fitness, resilience,
and strong character. More than just building athletic ability, our sports
programmes nurture well-rounded individuals who lead healthy, active, and
values-driven lives. Guided by dedicated coaches and teachers, students
learn game strategies, build physical and mental resilience, and cultivate
values such as perseverance, fair play, and sportsmanship. Through regular
training and competitions, students learn the value of discipline and teamwork.
Many of our school teams have represented the school with pride in the
National School Games, showcasing grit, skill, and camaraderie. Whether
committing to the rigour of competitive Football and Volleyball or exploring
a variety of games like Floorball and Handball in our Modular Sports programme,
students build mental toughness, coordination, and confidence.</p>
