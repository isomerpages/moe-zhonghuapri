<h2><strong>Scouts CCA</strong></h2>
<p>Scouts CCA offers an adventurous and enriching experience where students
grow into confident, responsible, and community-minded individuals. As
part of the Singapore Scouts Association, our Scouts develop essential
life skills through exciting hands-on activities such as outdoor cooking,
campfires, knot-tying, and nature hikes. Aligned with 21st Century Competencies,
the programme nurtures resilience, teamwork, critical thinking, and leadership
in every Scout. Whether taking on outdoor challenges or contributing to
meaningful community initiatives, our Scouts learn to lead with integrity
and adapt with courage—equipping them to thrive in school and in life.</p>
