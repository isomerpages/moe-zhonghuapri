<h2><strong>Visual and Performing Arts</strong></h2>
<p>Our Visual and Performing Arts CCAs—including Chinese Dance, Malay Dance,
Indian Dance, Choir, and Art Club—offer vibrant platforms for students
to explore their creativity, build confidence, and express themselves through
movement, music, and visual arts. Guided by experienced instructors, our
students learn a range of traditional and contemporary art forms, deepen
their cultural appreciation, and develop discipline and teamwork. Our Arts
CCAs have consistently achieved strong results at the Singapore Youth Festival
(SYF) and other national platforms, a reflection of our students’ dedication
and talent. Whether performing on stage or creating imaginative artworks,
our young artists grow into confident, resilient individuals with a deep
appreciation for the arts.</p>
