<h2><strong>Character &amp; Citizenship Education</strong></h2>
<p>The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Department plays a vital
role in shaping our students into values-driven individuals who are respectful,
responsible, and resilient. Anchored in the national CCE framework and
guided by the core themes of Identity, Relationships, and Choices, our
holistic approach ensures that values and social-emotional competencies
are meaningfully taught, modelled and practised across school experiences.
CCE is delivered through dedicated Form Teacher Guidance Periods, Mother
Tongue lessons, and immersive learning experiences such as Values-in-Action
projects, cohort learning journeys, student leadership programmes, and
National Education events. Our students explore important content areas
such as Cyber Wellness, Mental Health, Family Education, Sexuality Education,
and Education and Career Guidanceâ€”enabling them to make responsible decisions
and contribute meaningfully to society. Contemporary issues such as sustainability,
online behaviour, and global conflicts are also thoughtfully discussed
to develop critical thinking, empathy and a strong moral compass. Through
this integrated approach, we aim to nurture active citizens who are anchored
in values, aware of their role in nation-building, and prepared to lead
with heart in an ever-changing world.</p>
