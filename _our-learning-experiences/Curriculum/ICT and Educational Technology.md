<h2><strong>ICT and Educational Technology</strong></h2>
<p>Coding and Making – Developing Digital Literacy in Our Pupils
<br>In 2020, MOE unveiled the National Digital Literacy Programme so that
at different stages of their education journey, pupils will be able to
acquire digital skills across four components in the “Find, Think, Apply,
Create” framework.
<br>In line with the national development pathway, the school has a systemic
approach to develop computational thinking in our pupils through coding
and making.</p>
<p>Computational Skills
<br>The intent of coding is to develop computational thinking in our pupils
starting from Primary 1. The programme spiral upwards and develop pupils
progressively in this higher order thinking competencies.
<br>
<br>Computational thinking includes elements such as:
<br>1. Decomposition – breaking a large problem down into smaller ones
<br>2. Pattern recognition – recognising how these smaller problems relate
to ones that have been solved in the past
<br>3. Algorithm design – Identifying and refining the steps necessary to
reach a solution
<br>4. Debugging – Refining those steps
<br>
<br>Developing computational thinking will also develop the following skill
sets in our pupils:
<br>1. Experimenting and iterating – developing something, trying it out,
and then developing some more
<br>2. Testing and debugging – finding and solving problems as they work
<br>3. Abstracting and modularizing – exploring connections between the whole
and the parts
<br>
<br>Our pupils are provided with opportunities to learn coding using screen-free
programing such as MatataLab in Lower Primary and more serious block-based
programming such as Scratch, Microsoft PXT or Code.org from Middle Primary
to Upper Primary.&nbsp; Our school leverage iMDA’sCode for Fun Programme
to nurture a new generation of digital natives.
<br>
<br>During each level programme, pupils are provided with opportunities to
work in teams on scenarios that represent real-world problem. The pupils
then pitch their ideas and hypothetical solutions to their peers. They
are provided with platforms to communicate and display their artefacts
and concepts.
<br>
<br>Through these efforts, we achieve the following in our pupils:
<br>1. Cultivate real-world problem solving
<br>2. Encourage digital creativity and innovation
<br>3. Foster collaboration and co-creation with like-minded digital makers</p>
