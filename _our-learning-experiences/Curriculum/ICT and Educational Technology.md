<h2><strong>ICT and Educational Technology</strong></h2>
<p>The ICT Department is dedicated to equipping students with the digital
literacy and future-ready skills essential for success in a fast-evolving
world. In alignment with MOE’s National Digital Literacy Programme and
the “Find, Think, Apply, Create” framework, our school adopts a systemic
and progressive approach to nurture computational thinking from as early
as Primary 1. Through our Coding and Making programme, students are introduced
to coding using screen-free tools like MatataLab in the lower primary years,
and advance to block-based programming platforms such as Scratch, Microsoft
PXT, and Code.org in upper levels. Supported by initiatives like the iMDA
Code for Fun programme, students learn to break down problems, recognise
patterns, design algorithms, and troubleshoot solutions — developing valuable
skills such as experimentation, iteration, abstraction, and teamwork. Our
students work collaboratively on real-world challenges, pitch solutions
to peers, and proudly present their digital creations. These experiences
not only ignite their digital creativity and innovation but also cultivate
resilience, communication, and collaborative problem-solving – key traits
of confident digital learners and creators.</p>
