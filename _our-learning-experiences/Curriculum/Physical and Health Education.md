<h2><strong>Physical and Health Education</strong></h2>
<p>The Physical &amp; Health Education (PHE) Department is committed to nurturing
active, confident and resilient individuals who value a healthy lifestyle.
Our PE curriculum promotes holistic development through the acquisition
of fundamental movement skills, game play concepts, and values such as
teamwork, discipline and perseverance. Students enjoy a rich variety of
learning experiences, from athletics and dance to modified games and outdoor
education. Signature programmes such as the Recess Play @ ZPS, Outdoor,
Leadership and Environmental Education Programme (OLE) and our annual Sports
Carnival foster confidence, sportsmanship and teamwork. Our PHE lessons
are thoughtfully designed to encourage students to take responsibility
for their own physical well-being, make informed choices about their health,
and develop a lifelong appreciation for physical activity. Through these
experiences, we aim to nurture positive attitudes that will empower them
to lead active and fulfilling lives.</p>
