<h2><strong>Programme for Active Learning</strong></h2>
<p>The Programme for Active Learning (PAL) at ZPS offers all Primary 1 and
2 students a vibrant and engaging platform to explore and grow through
four key domains: <strong>Outdoor Learning</strong>, <strong>Visual Arts</strong>, <strong>Sports and Games</strong>,
and <strong>Speech and Drama</strong>. These thoughtfully designed experiences
promote <strong>holistic development</strong>, allowing students to grow
morally, socially, physically, cognitively, and aesthetically. PAL places
strong emphasis on nurturing <strong>core values</strong> such as <strong>Respect</strong>, <strong>Resilience</strong>, <strong>Responsibility</strong>, <strong>Integrity</strong>,
and <strong>Care</strong>, while equipping students with vital <strong>social-emotional competencies</strong> like <strong>self-awareness</strong>, <strong>relationship management</strong>,
and <strong>responsible decision-making</strong>. With a focus on process
over product, PAL encourages creativity, teamwork, and confident self-expression
in a safe and encouraging environment where students can learn and grow
at their own pace. It is a key part of our vision to nurture <strong>curious, compassionate and confident individuals</strong> who
are ready to thrive both in school and in life.</p>
