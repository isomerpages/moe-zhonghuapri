<h2><strong>Programme for Active Learning</strong></h2>
<p>The Programme for Active Learning (PAL) at ZPS offers all Primary 1 and
2 students a vibrant and engaging platform to explore and grow through
four key domains: Outdoor Learning, Visual Arts, Sports and Games, and
Speech and Drama. These thoughtfully designed experiences promote holistic
development, allowing students to grow morally, socially, physically, cognitively,
and aesthetically. PAL places strong emphasis on nurturing core values
such as Respect, Resilience, Responsibility, Integrity, and Care, while
equipping students with vital social-emotional competencies like self-awareness,
relationship management, and responsible decision-making. With a focus
on process over product, PAL encourages creativity, teamwork, and confident
self-expression in a safe and encouraging environment where students can
learn and grow at their own pace. It is a key part of our vision to nurture
curious, compassionate and confident individuals who are ready to thrive
both in school and in life.</p>
