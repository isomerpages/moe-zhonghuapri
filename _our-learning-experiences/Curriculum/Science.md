<h2><strong>Science</strong></h2>
<p>The Science Department is dedicated to sparking curiosity and developing
scientific literacy in every child. Our curriculum is designed to nurture
students as inquirers who can make sense of the world around them through
the lens of science. Our engaging learning experiences develop not only
conceptual understanding and process skills but also strengthen studentsâ€™
ability to apply scientific knowledge to real-life situations in responsible
and ethical ways. Through hands-on investigations, Science outdoor learning,
and our signature LLP in Environmental Education, students learn to ask
questions, explore ideas, and think critically about global and local issues.
Emphasising the development of values such as responsibility, curiosity
and integrity, our science curriculum seeks to inspire a lifelong interest
in science while equipping students with the competencies needed to navigate
an increasingly complex and interconnected world.</p>
