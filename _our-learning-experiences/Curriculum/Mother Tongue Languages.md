<h2><strong>Mother Tongue Languages</strong></h2>
<p>At Zhonghua Primary School, the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department
plays a vital role in nurturing our studentsâ€™ cultural identity and communication
skills through the learning of Chinese, Malay, and Tamil languages. Guided
by the principles of the Mother Tongue Language curriculum, our programme
is designed to help students develop a strong foundation in listening,
speaking, reading, and writing, while fostering an appreciation of the
rich heritage and values embedded in each language. Through interactive
approaches such as storytelling, drama, cultural immersion activities,
and digital learning tools, students experience the language in authentic
and engaging ways. Signature programmes like Cultural Camp, Reading Weeks,
and language competitions further enhance their linguistic confidence and
cultural appreciation. We aim to nurture bilingual and bicultural individuals
who not only use their Mother Tongue Languages effectively but also take
pride in their roots and traditions in an increasingly globalised world.</p>
