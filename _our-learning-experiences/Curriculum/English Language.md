<h2><strong>English Language</strong></h2>
<p>The English Department is committed to nurturing confident, empathetic
and effective communicators through engaging and purposeful learning experiences.
Our programmes aim to develop students who are critical readers, creative
inquirers, and articulate speakers and writers. Through providing a strong
foundation in the language through the integration of reading, writing,
speaking, listening and viewing skills, signature programmes such as ZPS
Spotlight, ZPS Reading Challenge and oracy-based experiences in speech
&amp; drama and debates, foster language appreciation, creativity and collaborative
learning. The learning experiences are designed to empower students to
use English meaningfully across diverse contexts, while nurturing a love
for language and the confidence to express themselves thoughtfully in our
ever-evolving world.</p>
