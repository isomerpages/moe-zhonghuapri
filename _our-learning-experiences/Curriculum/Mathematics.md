<h2><strong>Mathematics</strong></h2>
<p>The Mathematics Department strives to nurture every child into a confident
and competent problem solver with a deep appreciation for the use of mathematics
in daily life. Learning experiences are thoughtfully designed to move beyond
rote learning with a strong emphasis on fostering critical and inventive
thinking. Key programmes such as Fun with Math, Mathematics Show and Tell
and Project Work allow students to explore mathematical ideas through modelling
and retelling, hands-on activities and real-world applications. We place
a strong focus on engaging students in meaningful ways to develop their
confidence and perseverance in problem-solving through inquiry-based learning.
By building a strong foundation in numeracy and cultivating a positive
mindset towards learning mathematics, we aim to prepare our students to
be future-ready learners who enjoy learning and applying mathematics in
authentic contexts.</p>
